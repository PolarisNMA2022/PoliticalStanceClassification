# PoliticalStanceClassification

## Introduction

This is a repository collecting all the codes and data of the project done by Team "Polaris" at NMA 2022 Deep Learning Boot Camp. We use logistic regressions and neural networks applied to articles of news data from [BIGNEWS](https://github.com/launchnlp/POLITICS) to make classification of its political stance, among left, center, and right.

Specifically, we make a prediction on the political stance of the article based on the whole article (logistic regression) or first 512 words (BERT) or 1000 words (Longformer) of the article.

This is intended as a demonstrate of the applications on this data set.

## BIGNEWS Dataset

The [POLITICS project](https://github.com/launchnlp/POLITICS) provides the BIGNEWS data set, collecting 3,689,229 English news articles on politics, gathered from 11 United States (US) media outlets covering a broad ideological spectrum, with its political orientation was classified based on their media outlets.

We focus on randomly sampled 255,000 articles, consisting of three chunks containing 85,000 articles from left, center, and right respectively. Our dataset can be obtained via [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HVmXj-dzE0WfLxuOiT4dCcuKpd7ujOOo?usp=sharing)
